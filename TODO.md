# Todo

- [x] Bug where 2nd time opening sheet music doesn't show - probably need to wipe the noteflight container, skip NF re-init
- [x] Adjust bpm ui
- [x] Remove named part "Piano"
- [x] Clear tmp/ cache button
- [ ] Remove imagemagick dependency (preferably replace with pure opencv. otherwise if too messy, replace with sharp for flattening images, use vips from sharp to join https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/1175#issuecomment-377678250)
- [ ] Icon
- [ ] Test on all platforms
- [ ] Docs
- [ ] Home button to really clear state and stop things running
- [ ] Import into noteflight (via launch api)
- [ ] Cache deps for github ci
