# flowkey-scraper

Flowkey scraping to generate a music xml file for a song.

This tool most likely violates the flowkey TOS, so please use at your own risk and please do not absuse the tool. I have made this tool for educational purposes (as I learn piano) since it is a useful way for me to use the flowkey arrangements. _I WILL NOT BE PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THIS TOOL IN MOST CASES. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THIS TOOL WILL WORK IN THE FUTURE._ I have heard that if you ask for sheet music from the flowkey support team that they usually will give it to you, so that might be a better approach if you are not tech-savy or are not sure about the risks.
